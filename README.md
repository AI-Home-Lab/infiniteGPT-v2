# InfiniteGPT 🚀

InfiniteGPT is a Python script that lets you input an unlimited size text into the OpenAI API. No more tedious copy & pasting. It's a single python script that can connect to any of the OpenAI API chat models (gpt-3.5-turbo, gpt4, etc.). 

This eliminates the need for re-prompting when using a large text input or copying and pasting endless chunks of text into chatGPT. 📚
